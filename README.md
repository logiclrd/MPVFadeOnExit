# MPV Fade On Exit

This is a simple script to allow a gentle fade out when stopping playback in [MPV](https://mpv.io).

## Usage

With this script loaded, press Ctrl+Q instead of Q to end playback and the video will gracefully fade out before exiting.

## Configuration

There is none presently.

## Installation

Place the `mfoe.lua` script file (or a link to it) into `~/.config/mpv/scripts`. You may need to create this directory.
